This directory contains K-Means clustering examples built on synthetic datasets.

Currently included:
- 2D K-Means with synthetic data generation
- 3D K-Means with synthetic data generation
- Elbow method for selecting the number of clusters
- Model training using fit and cluster assignment using fit_predict
- Cluster visualizations with centroids

Planned additions:
- Explicit separation of fit and predict workflows
- Prediction on unseen / new data points
- High-dimensional (3+ features) K-Means examples
- Visualization of high-dimensional clustering using dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA)
